This repository contains various approaches to solve [1Ô∏è‚É£üêùüèéÔ∏è The One Billion Row Challenge](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/onebrc) using the Python ecosystem.
Contrary to the rules of the challenge, external dependencies are used.

## Execution Benchmarks

Next follows a table with benchmarks for all approaches.
The sample size is 100_000_000.
These benchmarks are the Average Execution Time (AET) in seconds for 10 executions.
Please refer to [exec_logs](./exec_logs/) for the execution log of these benchmarks.
It is possible for each approach to be applied to different Python implementations.
Please refer to [Python Implementations](#python-implementations) for more information on the variants used.

| Implementation         |       CPython AET | CPython_PerfOpt AET |
| :--------------------- | ----------------: | ------------------: |
| `00_native_DictReader` | 95.10874163000008 |   85.06736754700069 |
| `01_native_split`      | 37.37240671530003 |   35.62867767150019 |
| `02_native_read_text`  | 43.90962733860001 |  41.248077518200446 |

### Conditions

- CPU: 12th Gen Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-1255U √ó 12
- RAM: 16.0¬†GiB
- All benchmarks are executed inside a docker container
  - To avoid any performance penalty due to docker security features, the `--privileged` flag is used when running the container
  - This is suggested by [this](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/docker-performance-overhead/) Python‚áíSpeed article
  - Please refer to the `./scripts/docker_run_*.sh` scripts to see exactly how tests are executed under docker

## Approaches Description

- `00_native_DictReader`: read DictReader item by item, updating an accumulator dict iteratively
- `01_native_split`: read from Path.open() line by line, splitting the line by ";" and updating an accumulator dict iteratively
- `02_native_read_text`: use Path.read_text() to load the entire file at once, splitting by "\n" and then by ";", and finally updating an accumulator dict iteratively

### Python Implementations

- **CPython**: the standard, vanilla Python implemented in C
- **CPython_PerfOpt**: is the same as CPython, but compiled and built as per the [Python Developer's Guide](https://devguide.python.org/getting-started/setup-building/index.html#optimization) with the following flags:
  - [`--enable-optimizations`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-enable-optimizations) (enables Profile Guided Optimization)
  - [`--with-lto`](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-with-lto) (enables Link Time Optimization)
